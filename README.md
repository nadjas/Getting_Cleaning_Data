# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Assignment

Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Your actions 

1. Download the data source zip file and extract it into your working directory. You'll have a ```UCI HAR Dataset``` folder containing two subfolders "data" and "test" (for the purpose of this assignment we'll ignore the sub-subfolder inside each of the above called "Inertial Signals").
2. Put ```run_analysis.R``` in your working directory.
3. Run ```source("run_analysis.R")```. It will generate a new file ```tidydata.txt``` in your working directory. Done!

Please refer to the CodeBook for the details of the code and description of data.
